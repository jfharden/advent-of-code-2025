This is assembly written for the [dasm assembler](https://dasm-assembler.github.io/).

To actually assemble this you will need the atari 2600 machine macros.h and vcs.h to be placed into the `includes/` directory.
They have been added to the .gitignore so I don't accidentally commit them.

The Makefile assumes using [stella emulator](https://stella-emu.github.io/)

The cart has been made for PAL consoles (since I'm in the UK)
